# My Favorite Vacation Destination!


### Italy
> Italy was a very fun place to go. There was a lot of culture and history. The food was amazing and the people were very nice.

### Canada
>Canada was dope, its only a couple hours drive from where I live and the weather was amazing.

###  Mexico
>Mexico has some of the best food that I have ever experienced. There is music around every corner and there is a party going on every night. It is also home to some of the best kayaking areas.

### United States

> I have been to many states and each one has their own special thing. I have been to...
* California
* Alaska
* Oregon


##### California
>I was born and raised in southern California and have many fond memories of this area.

#### Alaska
> I went on a  cruise to Alaska and here we travelled back in time to the last frontier. Some of the best hiking trails are here.

#### Oregon
> I have lived in Oregon the past five years . I attended the University of Oregon and after graduation decided to stay in the state. There is so much to do from driving to the coast to going to a winery to hiking through the forests.
